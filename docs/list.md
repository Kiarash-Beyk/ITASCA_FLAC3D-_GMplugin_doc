The following lists are generated as data (logs, formation horizons, faults, well trajectories) are imported for model 
construction. These lists are used for data population and data inquiry. Names of data sets in the lists are set by 
main input data files such as "FormationTops.csv", and can’t be changed. To see the content of the lists type and 
execute this command in FLAC3D command line: fish list contents ‘List-name’ 


:material-rhombus-split: Wells: (key=well name, value='True'/'False') holds imported well names and a 'True' or 'False' flag 
indicating whether a well trajectory has been imported for the well (It is generated by 
"Import_Well_Names" function )

:material-rhombus-split: Horizons: (key=integer, value=string) key is just a row number. Value is the row of data read from 
"Horizon/FormationTops.csv" file, which holds formation names by their well picks for all imported wells 
(It is generated by " Import_Horizons " function) 

:material-rhombus-split: Faults: (key=fault geometry set name, value=fault name) it is used to group model zones intersecting 
faults (It is generated by "import_faults" function) 

:material-rhombus-split: Logs: (key=log name, value=extra index) log names are read from "borehole-name"_log.csv files in “Log” 
folder (It is generated by "Well_log_import_all" function) 

:material-rhombus-split: added_Wells: (key=well name, value='True'/'False') holds a list of added wells. The wells stored in this 
map will not be included in any data population and interpolation. Just for inquiry and visualization (It is 
generated at the beginning of project. Wells are added/removed by "add_well" and "remove_well" 
functions)
