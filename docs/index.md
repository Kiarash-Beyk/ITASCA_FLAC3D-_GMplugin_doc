All functions are run on FLAC3D version 7 and use some FLAC3D built-in utilities. Modeling settings are: 

:material-rhombus-split: All Z values are TVDSS shown as negative (-) numbers below mean sea level. all imported data must follow 
this convention 

:material-rhombus-split: Invalid data (log and zone property) is -9999 

:material-rhombus-split: Invalid depth values (well picks, or any other depth related) 9999 

:material-rhombus-split: Most functions generate an informative error message if fail to operate successfully. The message is 
printed in FLAC3D command window upon function run.
